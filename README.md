__FreeGemas__ is an open source version of the well known Bejeweled, for GNU/Linux, Windows, OS X and iOS. It's written in C++ using [Gosu](https://www.libgosu.org/).

This is a port back to Gosu from (TheOm3ga's new SDL 2 port)[https://github.com/JoseTomasTocino/freegemas]. The original Gosu-based code can be found at [Google Code](http://freegemas.googlecode.com).

## WHY!! port it back to Gosu?

I needed toy project for C++ Gosu that would work on desktop and mobile, and I like this codebase :)


## Installation

TODO - if you are fluent in either CMake or CocoaPods, you can figure it out in the meantime.
